# Zomato Data Analysis using python 

Libraries Used
The project utilizes several Python libraries to facilitate data analysis, visualization, and manipulation:

## 1. Pandas
   
Purpose: Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides easy-to-use data structures like Series (one-dimensional) and DataFrame (two-dimensional) to work with structured data.
Common Use Cases:
Reading and writing data from various formats (CSV, Excel, JSON, SQL, etc.).
Cleaning and transforming data, such as handling missing values or renaming columns.
Performing operations like grouping, merging, and filtering datasets.
Example:
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv("zomato_data.csv")
print(data.head())  # Displays the first few rows of the dataset

3. NumPy
   
Purpose: NumPy (Numerical Python) is essential for numerical computing in Python. It provides high-performance multidimensional arrays and mathematical functions to operate on them efficiently.
Common Use Cases:
Handling numeric data and performing mathematical operations.
Generating random numbers or creating arrays for simulations.
Supporting operations like vectorization for faster computations compared to Python loops.
Example:
import numpy as np
array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
print(np.mean(array))

5. Matplotlib
   
Purpose: Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It serves as the foundation for other visualization libraries like Seaborn.
Common Use Cases:
Plotting basic graphs like line plots, bar plots, and scatter plots.
Customizing chart elements like titles, labels, and legends.
Saving plots as images for reports or presentations.
Example:


import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
ratings = [3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0]
count = [10, 20, 15, 5]
plt.bar(ratings, count)
plt.xlabel("Ratings")
plt.ylabel("Count")
plt.title("Restaurant Ratings Distribution")
plt.show()

4. Seaborn
   
Purpose: Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and specializes in creating visually appealing and informative statistical graphics. It simplifies creating complex visualizations.
Common Use Cases:
Drawing plots like heatmaps, boxplots, and violin plots.
Adding statistical summaries and confidence intervals to visualizations.
Automatically managing chart aesthetics and styles.
Example:

import seaborn as sns
sns.set(style="whitegrid")
sns.boxplot(x="Cuisine", y="Ratings", data=data)
plt.title("Ratings by Cuisine")
plt.show()


These libraries form the backbone of data analysis in Python, with Pandas and NumPy handling data processing and Matplotlib/Seaborn providing tools to visualize insights effectively.
